# Enchanted Shooter â€“ A Lyric Guessing Game

Enchanted Shooter is a bubble-shooterâ€“style lyric guessing game inspired by Taylor Swiftâ€™s songs. Built with Svelte (frontend) and FastAPI (backend), it combines fun gameplay with NLP-powered lyric prediction using N-grams.

Players pick a Taylor Swift song, choose a difficulty level, and shoot the correct lyric bubbles to complete the missing words. With limited hints and a scoring system, it challenges both your memory and quick thinking while keeping the experience engaging and rewarding.
